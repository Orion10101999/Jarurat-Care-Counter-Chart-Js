# React Counter Application

## Overview

This React application features a counter with various functionalities, including incrementing, decrementing, undo/redo operations, and an input form to set the counter value. The application uses Chart.js to display a bar chart representing the counter's progress and a vertical progress bar to visualize the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Increase or decrease the counter value by 1.
- **Undo/Redo**: Navigate through the history of counter values to undo or redo changes.
- **Input Form**: Set the counter value directly by entering a number between 0 and 150.
- **Bar Chart**: Visualize the current counter value using a bar chart provided by Chart.js.
- **Progress Bar**: Display a vertical progress bar that updates based on the counter value.
- **Notifications**: Show toast notifications for errors and updates using `react-hot-toast`.

## Technologies

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Chart.js**: Library for rendering charts.
- **react-chartjs-2**: React wrapper for Chart.js.
- **react-hot-toast**: Library for showing toast notifications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
